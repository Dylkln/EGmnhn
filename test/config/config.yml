# ===== PREPROCESSING ===== #

# Either a file containing all paths to fasta format file(s), or path(s) to fasta format file(s).
# if several files are provided the program will concatenate all the files first.
fasta: tr_files_test/*


# If you already have some files that you created before, and you wish them to be processed by the workflow,
# you can put their names in the appropriate place in this config file.

# The name of the file containing all sequences you need to treat. By default, this file will be named "all_data.fasta".
concat_file: all_data.fasta

# The name of the diamond database format created by the command "makedb" of diamond-aligner software.
# By default, this file will be named "all_data_db.dmnd".
diamond_database: all_data_db.dmnd

# The name of the diamond blatp file created by the command "blastp" of diamond-aligner software.
# By default, this file will be named "diamond_ssn"
diamond_blatp: diamond_ssn




# ===== ATTRIBUTES ===== #

# File(s) containing the attributes associated to the sequences ID.
annotation: an_files_test/*

# Columns you want to keep in you sequence similarity network (please put them in the same order as in your file)
# Example:

# peptides | length | database | date
# 1        | 100    | A        | 12-06-19
# 2        | 105    | B        | 12-06-19

# If you only want the first three columns as attributes for you sequence similarity network,
# the section "columns" of the config file should be like this :
# columns:
#   - peptides
#   - length
#   - database

columns:
  - peptides
  - length
  - database

# ===== FILTRATION ===== #

# Put the filtration parameter you want to use to filter the blatp.
# note that the filtration will always be >= of the value you put on this parameter.

filtration:
  overlap:
    - 80
  identity:
    - 80
    - 85

# ===== NETWORK CREATION ===== #

# If you want to extract informations of a preformed network saved,
# type the path of the file containing the graph, else, leave blank
network_file:

# The number of minimum neighbours you want in your connected components of the sequence similarity network
neighbours: 3

# If you want to keep ISOLATED nodes, insert "yes", else leave blank.
isolated: yes
